Join us for this informative webinar that will cover high-impact Generative AI use cases and best practices on how to scale Gen AI for your business with watsonx.

Register now Our next-generation enterprise studio for AI builders IBM® watsonx.ai™ AI studio is part of the IBM watsonx™ AI and data platform, bringing together new generative AI (gen AI) capabilities powered by foundation models and traditional machine learning (ML) into a powerful studio spanning the AI lifecycle. Tune and guide models with your enterprise data to meet your needs with easy-to-use tools for building and refining performant prompts. With watsonx.ai, you can build AI applications in a fraction of the time and with a fraction of the data. Watsonx.ai offers: Multi-model variety and flexibility: Choose from IBM-developed Granite models, open-source and third-party models, or bring your own model. Differentiated client protection: IBM stands behind IBM-developed Granite models and indemnifies the client against third-party IP claims. End-to-end AI governance: Enterprises can scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data across the business, using data wherever it resides. Hybrid, multi-cloud deployments: IBM provides the flexibility to integrate and deploy your AI workloads into your hybrid-cloud stack of choice. Get the ebook: Generative AI and ML for the enterprise Interactive demo Chat directly with an LLM in the watsonx.ai 30-day demo and augment an LLM's knowledge base by grounding it with documents utilizing a RAG pattern. This demo does not include agents or simultaneous chat with multiple models.

Features Foundation models Clients can bring in IBM-supported custom foundation models from Hugging Face and have access to other third-party models including Llama 3 and Mixtral 8x7b. They also have access to a family of IBM-developed foundation models of different sizes and architectures, including open-source Granite models and IBM customized Granite models to support enterprise domains and use cases such as RAG. See foundation models in watsonx.ai Explore how to choose the right foundation model All models watsonx.ai product screenshot Prompt Lab Where AI builders can work with foundation models and build prompts using prompt engineering. Within the Prompt Lab, users can interact with foundation models in the prompt editor using the Chat, Freeform or Structured mode. These multiple options will allow you to craft the best model configurations to support a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) type tasks including question answering, content generation and summarization, text classification and extraction.

IBM watsonx.ai: Chat mode IBM watsonx.ai: Chat mode (2:08) Tuning Studio Prompt-tune foundation models as part of our Tuning Studio to help tune your foundation models with labeled data for better performance and accuracy. Prompt-tuning is an efficient, low-cost way of adapting a foundation model to new downstream tasks without retraining the model and updating its weights. Once your model is tuned, you can start using it in the Prompt Lab. Subsequent releases will include capabilities for model fine-tuning as part of our Tuning Studio. New tuning studio watsonx.ai product screenshot Public preview now available Flows engine With its intuitive flow language, watsonx.ai flows engine simplifies the development process, allowing generative AI applications to be effortlessly deployed to the cloud, accessed via API calls or SDKs, and integrated into existing projects and architectures. The feature provides a range of pre-built AI flows for tasks such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Summarization, allowing developers to embed AI into their business processes seamlessly. Learn more about flows engine New flows engine watsonx.ai product screenshot Data science and MLOps All the tools, pipelines and runtimes powered by foundation models, a data scientist would need to support building ML models automatically. Automate the entire AI model lifecycle from development to deployment with connections to a variety of APIs, SDKs and libraries. watsonx.ai MLOps software screen Gen AI capabilities In the Prompt Lab, leverage foundation models to create better AI, faster. Experiment with different prompts for various use cases and tasks.
